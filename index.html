            <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
                <ul id="faq">
                    <li>
                        <p>Q: Why should I attend Atlas Symposium?</p>
                        <p>A: You're spending the next four years of your life there, you want to be informed about where you will be going. Universities have glossy viewbooks and pictures for you as well. Students, especially those representing their school just because they want to, will answer your questions honestly and tell the hard truths. This is the purest example of students helping other students.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Q: What schools are represented?</p>
                        <p>A: Atlas Symposium will be hosting student panellists from: the Schulich School of Business (York University); Queen’s Commerce (Queen’s University); the Waterloo School of Accounting & Finance (University of Waterloo); Rotman Commerce (University of Toronto); and the Richard Ivey School of Business (Western University).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Q: Why did you choose October 13th as opposed to any other date?</p>
                        <p>A: This date was not chosen arbitrarily. With certain competitions, sporting events, and open houses being held in the later part of the month, we wanted to make sure students would not have to make the tough decision of missing something. As former secondary students ourselves, we understand the difficulty of this choice and sought to eliminate it altogether.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Q: How are panellists selected?</p>
                        <p>A: Panellists are selected based on strong and consistent academic achievement, as well as their finding meaningful summer employment. These criteria are are applied in order to make sure that every school is represented by the best it has to offer, ensuring a standard of excellence across the panellists.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Q: What do I get for $15?</p>
                        <p>A: The information your learn at Atlas Symposium will save you money later on. This is because the insights gained from the panellists will almost certainly lead your to apply to one or two schools rather than the full five they were inclined to apply to initially. This will save you X amount on your OUAC university selection application, not to mention the time and money saved from not having to visit all the schools in question.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Q: Does your conference just cater to students interested in business?</p>
                        <p>A: Primarily, yes. However, the overall insights on each school are valuable to students interested in post-secondary education in general.</p>
